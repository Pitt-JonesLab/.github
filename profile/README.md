Increasing quantum circuit fidelity requires an efficient instruction set architecture that is tractable to to avoid implement with realizable qubits and modulators but provides the lowest latency circuit implementation errors from decoherence.  The choice of a two-qubit (2Q) hardware basis gate depends on a quantum modulator's native Hamiltonian interactions and applied control drives.%, which enable qubit couplings.  Ideally, the control signals are far from any resonance in the system, creating so-called parametric interactions among the coupled qubits. 
There are many physical implementations of superconducting qubit couplers, but the two general interactions they support are photon exchange and paired photon creation/annihilation. %each controlled by a distinct parametric drive frequency.
For qubits, each drive independently produces $\texttt{iSWAP}$~family gates, however, we can also combine these interactions, creating a wide design space of drive parameters that can realize very different potential gates with different computing capabilities. Since calibrating gates is an expensive process, determining the \emph{best gate} (or small set of gates) that can be realized by the driven coupler's Hamiltonian is critical.  This creates a tractable method to determine a 2Q basis gate (or gates) that will decrease overall circuit duration and by extension, improve coherence-limited fidelity.  A traditional way to measure the computational power of a basis gate is the Haar score.  However, given the nature of quantum algorithms a more practical metric could be efficiency of decomposition of the  $\texttt{CNOT}$ and $\texttt{SWAP}$ gates into a given physical gate.

In this paper, we propose a collaborative design approach to select the best ratio of drive parameters that determine the \emph{best basis gate} for a particular modulator.  However, the relationship between modulator drive parameters dictated by the Hamiltonian is non-linear.  This requires considering the \emph{theoretical computing power of the gate} along with the \emph{practical speed limit} of that gate, given the modulator drive parameters. The practical speed limit arises from the couplers' tolerance for strong driving when one or more pumps is applied,  for which some combinations can result in higher overall speed limits than others.  Moreover, as this 2Q basis gate is typically applied multiple times in succession, interleaved by 1Q gates applied directly to the qubits, the speed of the 1Q gates can become a limiting factor for the quantum circuit.  We propose a \emph{parallel drive} approach that drives the modulator and qubits simultaneously, allowing a richer capability of the 2Q basis gate and in some cases for this 1Q drive time to be absorbed entirely into the 2Q operation.  This allows increasingly short duration 2Q gates while mitigating a significant source of overhead in some quantum systems. Using our collaborative design approach can improve fidelity by 18\% for a random 2Q gate over the best basic 2Q gate, $\sqrt{\texttt{iSWAP}}$.

Noisy, Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers have reached the point where they can show the potential for quantum advantage over classical computing. Unfortunately, NISQ machines introduce sufficient noise that even for moderate size quantum circuits the results can be unreliable. We propose a collaboratively designed superconducting quantum computer using a Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLement (SNAIL) modulator. The SNAIL modulator is designed by considering both the ideal fundamental qubit gate operation while maximizing the qubit coupling capabilities. First, the SNAIL natively implements $\sqrt[n]{\texttt{iSWAP}}$ gates realized through proportionally scaled pulse lengths.  This naturally includes $\sqrt{\texttt{iSWAP}}$, which provides an advantage over $\texttt{CNOT}$ as a basis gate.  Second, the SNAIL enables high-degree couplings that allow rich and highly parallel qubit connection topologies without suffering from frequency crowding.  Building on our previously demonstrated SNAIL-based quantum state router we propose a quantum 4-ary tree and a hypercube inspired corral built from interconnected quantum modules.  We compare their advantage in data movement based on necessary $\texttt{SWAP}$ gates to the traditional lattice and heavy-hex lattice used in latest commercial quantum computers. We demonstrate the co-design advantage of our SNAIL-based machine with $\sqrt{\texttt{iSWAP}}$ basis gates and rich topologies against $\texttt{CNOT}$/heavy-hex and $\texttt{FSIM}$/lattice for 16-20 qubit and extrapolated designs circa 80 qubit architectures. We compare total circuit time and total gate count to understand fidelity for systems dominated by decoherence and control imperfections, respectively.  Finally, we provide a gate duration sensitivity study on further decreasing the SNAIL pulse length to realize $\sqrt[n]{\texttt{iSWAP}}$ qubit systems to reduce decoherence times.
